# TTCN-3 for Visual Studio Code

Adds language support for TTCN-3 to Visual Studio Code.  This extension is a fork of [Emmanuel Alap's TTCN-3 Language Extension](https://github.com/ealap/vscode-language-ttcn) and adds further smartness. Current features:

* Jump to Definition
* Snippets
* Syntax Highlighting


TTCN-3 support is powered by the [NTT/K3 Language Server](http://github.com/nokia/ntt). Please make sure you have it installed, because this extension cannot install `k3` for you, yet.


## Contribution

We are pushing hard to get to you as many features as soon as possible, but
there's still much to do in every corner. Help is very much appreciated.
